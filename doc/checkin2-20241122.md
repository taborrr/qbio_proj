# addressing prior feedback
We chose to focus on aligning the seven new phage genomes to one reference, Escherichia phage vB_EcoM Hdk5 
(Accession no: MK373780.1), to start wtih for clarity of our project. 
If we have time and want to later, we will consider aligning the seven new phage genomes to the two other references used in the 
original paper to be able to compare how well each maps to references of different genera. 
Thank you for the advice on how to use geom_react(), we are working on implementing this to visualize our alignments in the style
of the original progressive mauve plot we are basing it on but without using the depricated tool. 


# where we are at
Since last time, we have successfully aligned our seven new genomes to one reference! This was done using minimap2, which was a
bit more difficult than initially anticipated until we created a new conda environment to download minimap2 into; for whatever
reason we could not download it directly onto our computer and get it to run. The paf_output files out putted from minimap2 have 
been uploaded to the github. 
We are working on using R and ggplot to visualize them. We will check out ggseqlogo which was recommended in a peer review. 
We are also looking into paftools as a potential intermediate step to add into our protocol before plotting in R. 
We are also working on updating the README with clarifications from the other peer reviews that we received.

# struggles + questions
Do we need to use paftools on our paf_output files before we can plot in R? It seems like we should be able to do it both ways and
are exploring both options. 
Do you think as a reach goal creating a heat map to show where the alignments of the genomes vary is a good idea? Do you have 
any advice for executing this?
